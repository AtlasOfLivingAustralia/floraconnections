Community scientists and botany groups have a wealth of on-ground plant knowledge &mdash; knowledge that 
Government committees need to make decisions about managing priority plants across Australia.

You can help by joining Flora Connections and submitting surveys of these plants in your area. We 
provide a standardised survey that can be used to assess any plant species according to IUCN Red List 
criteria. This means that your observations are directly usable by scientists and are capturing as much 
useful information as possible.
