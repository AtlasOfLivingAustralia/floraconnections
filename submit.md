## Step 1: Do the survey

Flora Connections surveys are recorded on paper. We recommend bringing a clipboard and using a dark pencil, because pencils can still write on damp paper.

<a href="_assets/files/Flora Connections data sheet v3.pdf" class="link_as_button">Download a printable data sheet<br><small>(.PDF, 0.19 MB)</small></a>

Full instructions for filling out a data sheet can be found in the [complete guide (.PDF, 4 MB)](_assets/files/Flora Connections Guide.pdf).

You can also print this [completed example data sheet (.PDF, 0.26 MB)](_assets/files/Flora Connections data sheet v3 examples.pdf) to refer to in the field.

## Step 2: Upload the survey

Once your survey is complete, bring it back home and copy it into our online form. We collect data through _BioCollect_, which makes your surveys immediately accessible to scientists and government agencies.

If you can't do the full survey, you can add a quick two-question observation through the iNaturalist app on iPhone or Android instead.

### **Step 1.** Install iNaturalist on your phone, and create an account with it or sign into your existing one.

### **Step 4.** Answer our questions and _Share_ the observation!

We want to know **how many individuals** you're seeing at the site, and **what disturbances have been happening, or will occur in the future**. Disturbances include disease, herbivory, human impacts, feral animals, erosion, weeds, flood, drought, and fire.
