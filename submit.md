## Step 1: Do the survey

Flora Connections surveys are recorded on paper. We recommend bringing a clipboard and using a dark pencil, because pencils can still write on damp paper.

Full instructions for filling out a data sheet can be found in the [complete guide (.PDF, 4 MB)](_assets/files/Flora Connections Guide.pdf).

You can also print this [completed example data sheet (.PDF, 0.26 MB)](_assets/files/Flora Connections data sheet v3 examples.pdf) to refer to in the field.

Once your survey is complete, bring it back home and copy it into our online form. We collect data through _BioCollect_, which makes your surveys immediately accessible to scientists and government agencies.
